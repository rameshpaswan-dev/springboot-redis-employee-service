🚀 Employee Management System using Spring Boot & Redis

A RESTful backend application built with Spring Boot and Redis to perform CRUD operations on Employee data.
This project demonstrates how Redis can be used as a fast in-memory data store without using Spring Data JPA.

📌 Features

Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Employee records

Redis used as primary data store (Hash-based storage)

Clean layered architecture (Controller → Service → Redis)

Generic API response structure

UUID-based employee ID generation

No database / No JPA – Redis only

RESTful APIs following best practices

🔹 Flow Explanation

Client sends REST request

Controller handles request

Service layer applies business logic

Data is stored/retrieved from Redis using RedisTemplate

Response is wrapped in a standard ApiResponse
